Hello Makers üëã

What an introduction to careers support at Makers‚Ä¶ the request to create your CV üòú

Many of you will have some form of CV but at Makers Academy we use Github CVs. They look like [this](https://github.com/JoshuaNg2332/cv).

We do this so that it's quick and easy for us to send your CV to our hiring partners and also so that they can flick through your commit history, your final projects, and your side projects all in one place.

Don‚Äôt panic there is plenty of support available and this exercise is a little warm-up to remind you of all the skills and strengths you‚Äôre bringing even before you‚Äôve started on the bootcamp itself. 

This is not a throw-away reminder, either. Makers are hired because you‚Äôre bringing so many transferable skills to the table. You know how to communicate in professional environments, contribute to and maybe lead teams. You show up to difficult problems with a solution-focused approach and you have the confidence to think through challenges before asking for help. You know how to manage yourselves, time, and have lots of examples of getting things done as a result. This applies to all of you, whether you‚Äôve come from customer service to consulting, parenthood to plumbing. The key to a great CV is to look back through your professional and personal experience and clearly communicate everything you've learned and all the skills you've developed. You don't need to have an impressive background to do that. Still, it can take a little time to remind yourselves of what you‚Äôve achieved to date. So let‚Äôs get started‚Ä¶

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
__Goal:  Create Your GitHub CV [1st Draft]__

At this stage, we‚Äôd like you to think about your transferable skills and how they have created the well-rounded professional contributor that you are. At least on a good day üòä. Think in particular about the skills you‚Äôve developed that will help you in a technical role. The following instructions will take you through the process of setting up your first draft.

Read through each step before you begin and be aware that there are some FAQs at the bottom of the page.

<details>
<summary> Step 1: Fork This Repo </summary>
<br>

   https://github.com/makersacademy/CV

        Please don't rename the repo - leave it as /cv
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 2: Complete the first draft of your profile</summary>
<br>

**In a concise summary, describe the key skills and experiences that evidence your strengths.**
  
  * What quantifiable skills and experience have you built up so far? Tell us about your professional and personal successes.
  * What has motivated you to go into software development? What first caught your interest? 
  * What are you interested in learning now?
  
 **Keep the following in mind when you‚Äôre writing your profile**


* How you start and how you end matters. Your profile can grab a reader‚Äôs attention and make them want to read on or do the total opposite.
* Make it clear that you are a software developer and include any special interests you have (it might be front-end or back-end). 
* Avoid "I am a teacher and aspiring software developer" turns of phrase. Claim your identity as a developer.
* Consider what you have to offer from day one and emphasise the value you can add. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 3: Professional History</summary>
<br>

**Write up your professional history to date as you would in a traditional CV putting your most recent experience first and working back from there.**

For each role, write down the skills you‚Äôve developed and the successes you‚Äôve had and make them relevant to the skills required in a technical role.

This means we don‚Äôt want to see you copying and pasting content from CVs you‚Äôve already written which is probably excellent if you want a job working in your previous industry. That is not why you‚Äôre here now is it?! ü´†
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 4 :  Grammar and Spell Check</summary>
<br>
  
üìù Run it through [Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or another spellchecker.
  
üìù Read it out loud to yourself (if you need to take a breath before you finish a sentence, it‚Äôs too long).

üìù Ask someone to read it through for you. 
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Final Step: Pin your new CV to your Github front page</summary>
<br>
  
There's a pin repo field at the top right of the screen.
  
</details>

‚òï Well done! You did it! Time for a break...

<summary>Help, this is too uncomfortable and now I‚Äôm stuck</summary>
<br>

Regardless of your level of experience, writing a CV for a new industry can bring up a lot of uncomfortable emotions. Feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, thoughts of not having a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù background or one that ‚Äú doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù are normal and you‚Äôre probably feeling these along with the rest of your cohort at the moment. Give yourself a little hug and move on.
  
Remember this is a first draft and a chance to gather your ideas and reflect on the past. Try writing notes or mindmaps before you commit to writing. If all else fails, just write a rubbish CV and refactor it like code.

</details>

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<details>
<summary>Help, I have no idea what my strengths are</summary>
<br>

Again, this is a common feeling and your journey success coach will support you at the end of the course to build a Github CV you can feel proud of. However, there are some key ways that you can start to unblock yourself now.

‚≠ê Ask yourself if you‚Äôre feeling a bit down or low-energy today. If that‚Äôs the case, leave your CV for now and come back to it when you‚Äôre feeling a little better. 
    
‚≠ê Go for a walk and think about your career history. Moving your body like this can help you unlock connections you haven‚Äôt made yet.

‚≠ê Ask your friends and family what strengths they see in you and ask them to explain their reasons. Some Makers have even sent a short survey out to their close network to find out what strengths others see in them.

‚≠ê Pay close attention to your successes at Makers and make a note of them. You could write an entire skills section and just write about Makers. Makers is a great place for transformation.

<summary>What else can I think about to create a stand-out CV?</summary>
<br>

üëâ **Get Organised** Bookmark this link so that you can come back to it at the end of the course for review.

üëâ **Keep your Github looking fresh** As you go through Makers, spend some time writing good READMEs for each project and pinning your projects to Github. This is the kind of material hiring managers like to look at.

üëâ **Write a blog** Employers are genuinely interested in your career change stories and are usually impressed to interview Makers who have written blogs about their technical and personal journey through Makers. An idea to blog can only become real if you dedicate time to writing even when you don‚Äôt feel like it. Book a meeting with yourself now to think about writing your blog and how you are going to set aside time to write it.

**Here are a couple of examples:**
  
https://kate-morris-new.medium.com/
  
https://medium.com/@FiddlersCode

but seriously, [there are loads](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l94sEDt5tn4GTzNrdoIJJVfv-KqY1qmI9gtnIrPLRhE/edit#gid=0).

We also have lots of blogs written by Makers on our [company page](https://makersacademy.medium.com/), too. 

üëâ**Read technical books, blogs or listen to podcasts** and keep your eye on tech meet-ups posted in the #events channel in slack. You can include meet-ups you go to regularly and favourite blogs, podcasts, and books on your CV as a great indicator of your interest in tech and a talking point at your next interview.
  
üëâ**After you graduate you might also think about creating your website** (using React naturally :) ) to showcase your work. This is particularly relevant if you‚Äôre applying for front-end roles. You‚Äôll notice that many of the CV examples include links to personal websites.

<summary> Is there support for those of us who are neurodiverse or don't feel confident with writing in English? </summary>
<br>  

You will be allocated your own journey success coach after you graduate who will work with you as an individual. If you tell us you have an additional learning requirement (it doesn‚Äôt need to be formerly diagnosed) then we‚Äôll talk to you a bit about how you are affected and will agree on a support plan with you around it. The same applies if English is not your first language.

If you don‚Äôt have easy access to a confident English speaker and writer then we‚Äôll want to make sure you send any written work to us to review before you send it to an employer.

If you want CV help now and don't want to wait until the end of the bootcamp, please send a direct message on Slack to @becks

<summary>  Why is the Github CV Important? </summary>
<br>
    
  
When you apply to a Makers hiring partner, we send them your Github CV. It‚Äôs the first introduction they get to you. Some are a little pickier than others and will look through your pinned repos and carefully read your CV and choose who they want to interview. Others prefer to meet you for a face-to-face interview or send you a tech test and reserve judgement based on your CV alone. So you can of course still get a tech test or interview if your CV is not quite yet perfected. However, you‚Äôll be increasing your opportunities if you‚Äôre able to make it an easy and enjoyable read for a hiring manager.

<summary>What‚Äôs the difference between a soft and hard skill?</summary>
<br>
    
A hard skill is like carpentry, baking, advanced Excel or (hey) coding. You learnt a skill and now you can create something with it. Tech languages and tools are hard skills You can write Ruby on your CV and a technical recruiter will know you can use Ruby and an Object Oriented Programming language. As a bootcamp graduate, we encourage you to back up the language with a project so we can see how you code in Ruby. You‚Äôll have to do this less and less the more experience you gain in the industry.

A soft skill is harder to define and includes communication, analysis, teamwork, presenting, getting things done. The way you evidence a soft skill is by describing a time when you successfully used that skill.

Here's an example

 
    ADAPTABILITY

    I consider myself a highly adaptive individual able to adjust based on the situation.
    
    Once I arrived to start my placement year in China with Goldwind, I found out during my onboarding process that I wasn't 
    suited for the role they needed. I asked my superior if there was a purpose I could fill in the department. Noticing a 
    communication issue with a different member of staff and an international intern, I inquired if it would be appropriate 
    for me to take care of the English speaking staff and escalate if necessary. It turned out to be a fruitful endeavour, 
    creating a role for myself where I could use the skill had and providing relief for an understaffed IT team.

<details>
<summary>What are transferable skills?</summary>
<br>
    
__Transferable skills are similar to soft skills.__ The implication is that although you have not worked as C# developer you have the skills required to speedily become one and add value to a business. The underlying skills to become a C# developer might be great attention to detail, problem-solving, self-led learning, learning quickly, teamwork, communication, and bug spotting. Again, wherever possible you want to back up each descriptor (e.g. great communicator) with an example. Anyone can say they are a great communicator but it is not understood as genuine unless you can describe a time when you used effective communication to achieve something.

<details>
<summary>Can I use this Github CV to apply for jobs outside of Makers?</summary>
<br>

These CVs are great to send directly to an engineering manager or an otherwise technical person. However, when you are applying to companies outside of Makers you'll probably need a slightly more traditional CV that might look something like [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WpyMBLu2hvxbhKCbAOP-E33-OZuJak9_)

There are three reasons for this.
1. You're applying through a system that asks you to "upload" a CV and you need to drop a PDF rather than a link
2. You're sending your CV to someone in HR or recruitment who doesn't have a Github account
3. You also write a cover letter to companies outside of Makers so your CV needn't be quite so long    
 
</details>

<summary>What is the STAR technique?</summary>
<br>
    
The STAR technique is a structure to use when you are describing experiences from your life. If you are asked a question that begins "tell me about a time when..." then using STAR will ensure your answer is clear, concise, and focuses on you.

You can use STAR in an interview but also think about how you can bring the same structure into a CV and cover letter.

It's described well in [this article.](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629)

<summary>What skills do hiring managers look for?</summary>
<br>

We've put together some thoughts from hiring managers on [what makes a good developer](https://github.com/BecksHookham/Github_CV/blob/main/what_makes_a_good_dev.md)

</details>

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<details>
<summary>I've just had a career break. How do I write about that?</summary>
<br>

Most of our employers like to have a full history of your experience and so it is important to account for every year of your professional history. Taking time out for a career break, travel, and learn something new are all part of working life. Please do write a little about what you were doing and perhaps even what you learned. If you took some time out to recover from an illness then it is standard to include this, too. If you are a domestic engineer (or parent), then this isn't a "break". Include it.

</details>

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<details>
<summary>I've just come out of full-time education and haven't had a job yet. How do I write about that?</summary>
<br>

We love when you come straight from education to Makers. Those of you who choose this path are always driven and excited about building a big career. It's such a great time to train in software because you have your whole professional lives to grow. 

You do have experience to write about. It just won't be about work experience. Write about your education, clubs, societies, volunteering, really anything you think makes you uniquely you. If you have had a part-time job in retail or similar then include this. You will have lots of skills to demonstrate including customer service and working under pressure.

</details>



__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<details>
<summary>I've got a lot of work experience, do I need to include everything?</summary>
<br>

Some companies do like to know what you've done every year of your professional life so you do need to make sure it's written down somewhere so they can request a complete version of your CV if they need it. You might choose just to write about the last 10 years of your career, or you might only include a description for jobs most relevant to tech. 

In the same way (particularly in hospitality) you might have changed jobs often but stay in a similar role. In this case, you might choose to write this in one section so it might look like this:

    Barback                                                                                             August 2016 - September 2022   
    Various high-end cocktail bars
    
    - Memorised over 50 cocktail recipes I was able to alter to suit individual preferences.
    - Et cetera
    
    
</details>


__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<details>
<summary>I don't really like this Github CV format. Can I invent my own?</summary>
<br>

Of course you can. The most important part of the Github CV is easy access to your Github portfolio. [Ben](https://github.com/BenSheridanEdwards/GitHub_CV) chose to upload his traditional CV and [Coral](https://github.com/Coral-Ann) for example uploaded both. As long as you convey your strengths as a developer and create an enjoyable reading experience for hiring managers then we encourage you to get creative.
